Majority of the upload files here will be random assets such as scripts and other pieces of code
once the project is has a working version, ill upload the entire project

This is just a school project, so a lot of the functions and features to flesh out the program arent really anything i would consider adding taking this forward.
instead of having to flesh out the menu and ui system, having the focus on learning and making a platform where thats easily possible - the controller scripting is what interests me the most.
at this stage in development (31/12/22) i am just trying to get all the ground work down. Basically, every script but the controller script.
Once i have the basis down for ticking boxes, i can really focus on making the tracking of movements and not just hand positions.
