A Unity-Based program that uses the SteamVR plugin to utilise its knuckles finger-tracking and motion detection data to perform gesture recognition on sign language  
-------
Majority of the upload files here will be random assets such as scripts and other pieces of code
once the project is has a working version, ill upload the entire project 
-----
Since this is more of a technical demonstration than a working product, the menu/UI system and other things unrelated will be noticably lacking in development in comparison to the scripts concerning the actual tracking systems.
The controller scripting is the main drive behind this project.
